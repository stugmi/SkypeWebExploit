# SkypeWebExploit
Badly written exploit for skype, it abuses web skype's poor decision to leave message ids in the open, just inspect element and get them.

### Example usage
```
$ python skype.py
Error uploading list index out of range
Usage: ./skype.py <user> <id> <message>
``` 
####To find the message id
![Message id location](http://i.imgur.com/4nkoPfe.png)
Ignore the msg_ and add it in. The user is just the skype username.


##Conv.py
Instead of username of the user you need the conversation ID which can easily be found via the web client.
Simply send a message, look at http requests after "messages" and you will see a request to an URL looking like "307d64c7ccdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeb6c9ca@thread.skype"
